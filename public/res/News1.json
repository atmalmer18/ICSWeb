			"content" : "DAVAO - After being spurned by Senator Grace Poe, Vice-President Jejomar Binay is now eyeing Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte as a possible running-mate in the 2016 elections. In an interview with ABS-CBN News Davao, Binay said he is open to the possibility of asking the popular Davao mayor if he is interested in joining forces as his running-mate. The vice-president described Duterte as highly qualified because of his successful record as mayor of Davao for 20 years. He said he and Duterte were both named in a feature article on successful mayors in the Philippines. Binay said he is also open to a change to federal form of government, which is Duterte's advocacy. However, he said the proposal still needs careful study. For his part, Duterte said he is not interested in running for higher office for now, adding that he cannot run because of his medical conditions. Binay, a former Makati mayor turned vice-president in 2010, is currently leading pre-election surveys as the candidate most likely to win the presidential election. He is statistically tied with Poe in the last Social Weather Stations with 36 percent of voters backing his presidential bid compared to Poe's 31 percent. -- Report by Rodirey Salas, ABS-CBN News"

			"title" : "Arum shoots down Pac-Floyd rematch rumor",
			"content" : "MANILA – Boxing promoter Bob Arum has denied speculations that a negotiation is now ongoing for a Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather rematch. The Top Rank, Inc. executive maintained that any fight related to the Filipino superstar will have to go through him. 'Unless they're negotiating with somebody else, it's not me,' said the veteran promoter in Steve Kim’s report to Boxing Scene. Arum said that the amount of potential fight revenue may have fueled speculations of a possible Pacquiao-Mayweather II. The super bout, which was dubbed as the “Fight of the Century,” garnered over 4.4 million pay-per-view buys. It is also expected to breach the $400 million mark in terms of gross revenue, assuring Mayweather of at least $200 million and Pacquiao, $100 million. 'There have been no negotiations, what everybody is saying, with the incredible amount of money that they did last time that neither guy can make anywhere near the money fighting somebody else than they could fighting each other,' said Arum. The fight failed to live up to the hype as Mayweather chose to engage Pacquiao in a tactical match, a strategy that bored many fans. Arum, however, believes a rematch can still generate a lot of money despite the underwhelming outcome of the May 2 bout. 'Nobody is saying they're going to do the money they did last time,'' he said. But the promoter stressed they will have to prioritize Pacquiao’s health before even entertaining any talk of a possible rematch. The Filipino boxer underwent a medical procedure for his torn rotator cuff, which he blamed for his loss against Mayweather. 'Why discuss it until we know that the guy can fight again?' Arum earlier told Fight Hype. 'I don't wanna be an alarmist, the doctor's sure that he can and everything but you know it's not a minor operation.'"
