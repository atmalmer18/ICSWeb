                        Mathematical Sciences and Physics (IMSP) was established with
                        the Division of Computer Science as on of its divisions.
                        Dr. Ann Inez N. Gironella was the first director of IMSP and Prof.
                        Wilfredo Cabezon was the first Division Head of the
                        Division of Computer Science. IMSP was established when
                        Dr. Emil Q. Javier was the Chancellor of UPLB. Together with the esablishment of the Division of Computer Science was the institution of the BS Computer Science (BSCS) curriculum in UPLB. Hence, the BS Computer Science Progrm was officially instituted in 1982.

                    government through the International Development Program (IDP) of Australian
                    Univerities and Colleges, the staff of the Division grew in number from initially
                    three to about ten with graduate degrees in Computer Sience.
                    The first students in the program were admitted.

ICS is instrumental in the institution of BSCS programs in UP Manila, UP in the Visayas (Cebu, Tacloban, and Iloilo), UP College Baguio, and UP Mindanao.
